        # This is a Comment
        echo "hello, World"

        $ bash script.sh

        rwx         rw-         r--

6. Variables

    (i) Variables Contains Peices of Data that can be used when Referenced the Variable
    (ii) In Bash Variables can be defined by starting with the name of the Variables followed by an Equal Sign "=" and then The Value to be Assigned

    (iii) Syntax:

        <variableName> = <value>
    
    (iv) In Bash Variable can be Used by first adding `$` sign then the name of the Variable

        Hello, It's nice to Meet you James
    
    (vi) Built-in Variables:

        (a) Built-in Variables in Bash are Variables which does not need to be defined by the User and rather is provided by the bash interpreter to Help us

        (c) `$USER`: Returns Name of The Current User

        (d) `$PWD`: Returns Current Working Directory

        (e) `$HOSTNAME`: Returns Your Computer Name

        (f) `$RANDOM`: Returns a Random Number in-between 0 and 32765
            
            (I) `$(($RANDOM % <n>))` Returns Random Number in-between 0 and <n>

    (vii) The Variables Provided by the Bash interpreter are `Enviorment Variables` meaning they can be used Everywhere and are Permanent Variables
    (viii) The Variables Defined by you The User are `Child Process` Variables meaning they cannot be used outside of where they are defined

    (ix) `export <VariableName>` makes the `Child Process` variable a `Enviorment Variable` meaning It makes that Variable Available Everywhere, but It doesn't make them Permanent meaning they can be lost after Shutdown/Restart
    (x) To Make a Enviorment Variable Permanent You'll need to be one your Home Directory and Open a File named ".bashrc" which is Hidden and Then Add Declaration for your File, export it, and finally logout and Log in Again, now That Variable is an Enviorment Variable and is Permanent unless you remove it from there

        $ cd
        $ nano .bashrc

        ```.bashrc
        
        export <variableName>=<Value>

        ```
        KEY: Ctrl + X
        KEY: Y
        KEY: Enter

        $ sudo pkill -u $USER

7. Text Editors:

    (i) Text-Editors in Bash let's you edit text/script files without leaving your terminal

    (ii) `nano <filePath>` most simple and built-in Text-Editor

8. Conditions

    (i) if
        
        if [[ <condition> ]]; then
            # If the condition is Met
        fi

    (ii) If..else:

        if [[ <condition> ]]; then
            # If the condition is Met
        else
            # If the condition is Not Met
        fi

    (iii) If..else:

        if [[ <condition> ]]; then
        
            # If the condition is Met
        
        elif [[ <DifferentCondition> ]]; then

            # If The First condition is Not Met this Condition will be checked
        else
        
            # If none of the conditions is Met
        
        fi

    (i) Case

        case $<variable> in 
            <value1>)
                #Commands to run if $variable == <value1>
                ;;
            <value2>)
                #Commands to run if $variable == <value2>
                ;;
            <value3>)
                #Commands to run if $variable == <value3>
                ;;
        esac

9. Loops

    (i) While Loops

        (a) Runs a Peice of Commands Over and Over While The Condition is True

        (a) Syntax:

            while [[ <condition> ]]
            do
                # Commands to run while the <condition> is true
            done
        
        (b) While Loops doesn't uses normal Comparison Operators instead uses Flags:

            (a) `<a> -lt <b>` returns true if `a` is less than `b`
            (b) `<a> -gt <b>` returns true if `a` is greater than `b`
            (c) `<a> -le <b>` returns true if `a` is less than `b` or equals to `b`
            (d) `<a> -ge <b>` returns true if `a` is greater than `b` or equals to `b`

        (b) Example:

            i=1
            while [[ $i -le 100 ]]
            do
                echo $i
                (( i ++ )) # Increasing The Value of `i` by 1
            done

            # Prints Every Line in a file One by One

            while read -r line; do
                echo $line # <-- `$line` represets the current line of the file
            done < file.txt # <-- File Name

    (ii) Until Loops

        (a) Runs a Peice of Commands Over and Over Until The Condition is True

        (a) Syntax:

            while [[ <condition> ]]
            do
                # Commands to run while the <condition> is true
            done
        
        (b) Until Loops doesn't uses normal Comparison Operators instead uses Flags:

            (a) `<a> -le <b>` returns true while `a` is less than `b`

            (b) `<a> -gt <b>` returns true while `a` is greater than `b`

        (c) Example:

            i=1
            until [[ $i == 100 ]]
            do
                echo $i
                (( i ++ )) # Increasing The Value of `i` by 1
            done

    (iii) For Loops

        (a) For Loops doesn't uses any Bytes and instead uses a Range based Loop

        (b) Syntax:

            for <iterator> in <list>; do
                # Commands to run
            done

        (c) Example:

            for i in {1..10}
                echo "This Loop has ran $i Times!"
            done

            $ ./script.sh

            This Loop has ran 1 Times!
            This Loop has ran 2 Times!
            This Loop has ran 3 Times!
            This Loop has ran 4 Times!
            This Loop has ran 5 Times!
            This Loop has ran 6 Times!
            This Loop has ran 7 Times!
            This Loop has ran 8 Times!
            This Loop has ran 9 Times!
            This Loop has ran 10 Times!
        
    (iv) Loop Controls

        (a) Loops Controls are Keywords that Controls the Flow of the Loops

        (b) `continue` skips the Current Iteration

        (c) `break` breaks/exits the Loop

Scripts:

10. Creating Scripts

    (i) File Extention for a Bash Script is "sh"

        script.sh <-- Bash Script

    (ii) add "#!/bin/bash" to the first line of the Script to Define that it must be run by Bash and not any other kind of Scripting Language

        #!/bin/bash
        echo "Hello, World"

    (iii) Running a Bash Script: `bash <path>` or `<path>`

        $ bash script.sh
        Hello, World

        $ # Make the File Executable
        $ chmod +x script.sh
        $ ./script.sh
        Hello, World

11. More About Scripts

    (i) `read <variableName>` while the Script is Running It takes An Input from the User and Stores it in the given Variable

        #!/bin/bash
        echo "What's Your Name?:"
        read name
        echo "Hello, $name!"

        $ bash script.sh
        What's Your Name?:
        FlytoTheSpace
        Hello, FlytoTheSpace!

    (ii) `$<Count>` Represets the Arguments Given to The Script Before Running The Script

        #!/bin/bash
        name=$1
        profession=$2
        echo "Hello, My name's $name!"
        echo "and I'm a $profession!"

    (iii) `$(<command>)` let's you get the return values of the Commands

        #!/bin/bash
        name=$(whoami)
        echo "Hello, $name!"

        flytothespace@ubuntu:~$ script.sh
        Hello, flytothespace

    (iv) `exit <0 or 1>` exits The Script with The Status of 0 or 1, 1 stands for Success and 0 stands for Error

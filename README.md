## Sources

| Rank        | Collection                             |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Good** | Documents, Professionals, TextBooks... |
| 🟡 **Fair** | Google, Wikipedia, Chatbots...         |
| ❌ **Bad**  | Conspiracies, 

**Good Sources**:

- Documents with Data, Logic and Reasoning to backup the information.
- Professionals with years of experience and expertise, maybe hard to reach out to one.
- TextBooks with legimitate sources and well documented pages.

**Fair Sources**

- Google a decent enough source of information due to it's large size.
- Wikipedia with articles on almost every subject
- Chatbots are fair to use as long as the information has logic, have further sources, and someone needs to act as an intermediary.

**Bad Sources**

- Conspiracies are a example of a bad source, since it abandons all logic and focuses on agreement.

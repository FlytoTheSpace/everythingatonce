# Deriavative

**Deriavatives** is the *Rate of change* over a *small amount of time*

The Deriavatives at their **core** are:
$$
\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
$$

- $y$ is a function with the argument $x$

    $y(x)$

- $x$ is the argument passed to the $y$ function

- $\Delta x$ is a very small amount, it is not infinitely small but it does approach 0, it is also the difference along the X axis between both points
- $\Delta y$ difference is the difference in the function's output with the arguments $x$ and $x + dx$
    
    $\Delta y = y(x + \Delta x) - y(x)$

## Notation

The Deriavatives are not usually written as their core, but rather in their own Notations

### Langrange's Notation


- $dx$ is equivalent to $\Delta x$ as $x$ approaches $0$

- $dy$ equivalent to $\Delta y$, The Difference in the function's outputs, given *slightely* different input

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
$$

The Deriavatives

$$
df = f(x + dx) - f(x) \newline
df + f(x) = f(x + dx) \newline
f(x + dx) = df + f(x)
$$

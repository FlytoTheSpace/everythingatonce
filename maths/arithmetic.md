# Arithmetic

**Arithmetic**: a field of Mathematics containing the very Foundational Basics about it

# Successor, Predecessor

**Successor**: A Number `+1` of The Previous One

$a+1$

**Predecessor**: A Number `-1` for the Previous one

$a-1$

# Addition, Subtraction
**Addition** `(Add)`: Sum of any 2 Numbers

$a\color{lime}+\color{white}b$

- Repeated Succession $b$ count of times on $a$

**Subtraction** `(Subtract)`: Subtraction of One Number from another

$a\color{red}-\color{white}b$

- Repeated Predecession $b$ count of times on $a$

# Multiplication, Division
**Multiplication** `(Multiply)`: Multiplication

$a\color{lime}\times\color{white}b$
- Repeated Addition of `a` with itself `b` count of times

**Division** `(Divide)`: Divison of a Number in `b`  count of peices

$a\color{red}\div\color{white}b$
- Divison of $a$ into `b` count of Parts/Components Evenly

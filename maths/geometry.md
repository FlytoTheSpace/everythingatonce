- **Point of Intersection**: when 2 lines cross each other and a point is formed

- **Parallel lines**: Lines that can Never Meet at any point.

- **Bisector**: a Line that divides another line or any Shape into 2 Pieces

- **Perpendicular**: when 2 Lines meet at 1 point and the Angle between them is $90\deg$ (`Right Angle`)

- **Perpendicular Bisector**: When a Line Bisects another line or Shape and the angle between them is a Right Angle

- **Transversal**: A lines that intersects two or more lines at distinct points

- **Region**: Interior and Boundary

### Angles

---

Unit:

Angles measured in degrees 

- $A$ = angle

- $A\degree$ $A\deg$

- $360\degree$ is the maximum value.

Types:
- **Acute Angle**: in which angle is $<90\degree$
- **Right Angle**: in which angle is $90\degree$
- **Obtuse Angle**: in which angle is greater than $90\degree$ and less than $180\degree$.

	$\angle a > 90\degree \land  \angle a < 180\degree$

- **Straight Angle**: in which angle is $180\degree$
- **Reflex Angle**: in which angle is greater than $180\degree$ and less than $360\degree$.

	$\angle a > 180\degree \land  \angle a < 360\degree$

- **Complete Angle**: in which angle is $360\degree$

Sum Types:
- **Complementary Angles**: when sum of 2 angles equals to $90\degree$

	$\angle a + \angle b = 90\degree$

- **Supplementary Angles**: when sum of 2 angles equals to $180\degree$

	$\angle a + \angle b = 180\degree$

### Circle

---

Line Segments and Curves:

![](../img/shapes/circle_segments.png)

- **Radius**, $r$: length from the Center of the circle to it's boundary in a straight line.
	- *Raddi*: plural for 2Radius

- **Diameter**, $2r$: length from one side of the boundary of the circle to it's opposite side boundary in a straight line.

- **Circumference**: Length of the Entire Boundary (`Perimeter`) of the Circle

$$
2\pi r
$$

- **Chord**: a Line Connecting 2 Points on the Boundary of the Circle

Areas:

- **Complete Area**:
		
$$

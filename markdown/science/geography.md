**Crop**: plants that are cultivated on a large scale.

**Types of Crops** (Based on growing season):
- **Kharif Crops**: swon in Rainy Season (June - September)
- **Rabi Crops**: crops grown in the winter season (October - March)

## Agriculture Practices

### 1. Preparation of Soil

*Concept*: Prepares the soil before the the field can be sown, loosened soil helps in the growth of earth worms and microbes, they help in soil loosening and add humus, only a few centimeters of the top layer soil supports plant growth, the soil is mositened before soing and manure is sometimes added to the soild before turning.
- **Tiling**, **Ploughing**: the process of turning/loosening the soil

**Equipment**:
- **Plough** (an ancient tool)
    - Usage: used for adding fertilisers, removing weeds, and tiling, used with a pair of bulls
    - Structure: made of wood or iron.
- **Hoe**: 
    - Usage: removing weeds, tiling, harvest
- **Cultivator**: A tractor driven vechicle that drags it's *shanks* along the field and cultivate the area

### 2. Sowing

*Concept*: The step in which the seeds are planted into the soil

**Equipment**:
- **Traditional Tool**: shaped like a funnel, seeds are passed down through two or three pipes
- **Seed Drill**: used with tractors, places seeds uniformly at equal distance and depth.

### 3. Manure and Fertilisers

*Concept*: subtances added into the soil for plant growth are Manure and Fertilisers

- **Manure**:
    - Usage: Replenishes the soil with nutrients and imporves soil fertility, 
    - Characteristics:
        - Natural Substance, obtained by decomposition
        - prepared in Fields
        - Humus Rich
        - Normal Amount of Nutrients
        - Increases friendly microbes
        - Improves soil texture
        - Makes Pores (gas exchange easier)

- **Fertilisers**
    - Usage: Increase nutrients in the soil by high margins
    - Characteristics:
        - Man-made Inorganic salt
        - made in Factories
        - No Humus
        - High Amount of Nutrients: Urea, Ammonium Sulphate, Super Phosphate, Potash, NPK
        - Excessive use causes unfertile soil and water pollution

### 4. Irrigation

*Concept*: Supply of water to crops at regular intervals

**Sources**: Wells, Tubewells, ponds, lakes, rivers, damsn and canals

**Traditional Methods**: Moat (pulling system), Chain Pump, Dhekli, Rahat

**Modern Methods**:

- **Sprinkler System**: used on uneven land, sprinkles water in crops using perpendicular pipes, used for: lawns, coffee, plantation etc.
- **Drip System**: best method for irrigation, water falls near the roots of the plant drop by drop, used for: fruits, plants, gardens, and trees.

### 5. Weed Removal

*Concept*: Removal of Plants that are not meant to be grown

- **Weeds**: Plants that grow along side crops and are not meant to be grown with the crops.
- **Weeding**: The Proccess of removal of weeds.
- **Weedicides**: chemicals that controlls the growth of weeds, sprayed during the vegetative growth of weeds

### 6. Harvest

*Concept*: cutting the crop after it has matured for use.

- **Harvest**: the Process of cutting the crop after it has fully matured.
- **Threashing**: the Process of seperation of seeds from the chaff.
- **Wonnowing**: the Process of Threshing using wind to blow our the seeds.

**Equipment**:

- **Sickle**: a simple tools used for harvesting
- **Harvester**: a machine used for harvesting
- **Threasher**: a machine used for threshing
- **Combine**: a machine which is both a Harvester and a Threasher

---

Some Harvest Festivals

- India: Pongal, Baisakhi, Holi, Diwali Nabanyam Bihu

### 7. Storage

*Concept*: Storage of Crops after they've been harvested 

Measures:
- Grains should be dried, (on small scale dried neem leaves can be used)
- protected from moisture, insects, animals, and microorganisms.

Storage
- Small Scale: Jute Bags, metal bins
- **Silos**, **Granaries**

- **Animal Husbandry**: animals given food, water and shelter for resources.

## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

The **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** implies that

$$
\int{\frac{df}{dx} \ dx} = f(x)
$$

it states that the integral and the deriavatives are opposites of each-other
and in the 2nd part it implies that:

$$
\int_{a}^{b}{f(x)\ dx} = F(b) - F(a)
$$

where 

$$
\frac{dF}{dx} = f(x)
$$

# Sequence

A sequence is a consecutive succession of any expression:

$$a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, ..., a_n$$

$$a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, ...$$

in the 2nd expression the $a_n$ is left out this usually means that the sequence is Infinite (i.e. it has no end) but often depends on the context and left ambigious, even if $a_n$ is explicitally there, it could be taken as $n \to \infty$

## Series

A type of Sequence, in which all the elements are summed up together.

$$
a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + ...
$$
$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{n} a_i
$$

e.g

$$
0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ... + n = \sum_{k = 0}^{n}k \newline
= \frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{k = 0}^{n}k\right)
$$

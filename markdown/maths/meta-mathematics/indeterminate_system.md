This Article Does not Specifically belong at any Mathematical Field it's an independent system of Mathematics also known as Meta-Mathematics.

hi, I'm the same kid as in the last article, this is the part 2 of the previous article, I highly encourage you to go read it before coming here as I'll be creating axioms for that system.

# Indeterminate-Systems

**Indeterminate**: is an object/expression $U$ with no determinate value, it can also represent object within the system $\mathbb{U}$

An **Indeterminate Form** is form of the Indeterminates $I$, often associated with the situation they arise from, it may restrict the scope of the indeterminate.

**Instance** are of Indeterminate Form, they can take any ***arbitary*** value as allowed by the system $\mathbb{U}$ and the Indeterminate Form.

described as $x \leftarrow I$

$$\newcommand{\setform}{\text{set}}$$

$$\setform(I)$$

is a the set of all instances of the indeterminate form $I$

## Axioms

$\forall I, I_1, I_2$

- **Determinism**: if there is only 1 possible indeterminate instance, then it is The Value of the Indeterminant.

$$|\setform(I)| = 1 \implies \exists! x \in \setform(I) [I = x]$$

- **Arbitary Value**: Indeterminates are equal to every instance within their set of instances.

$$\forall x \in \setform(I) [I = x] $$

- **Instance**: An Instance of an indeterminate belongs within it's set of instances.

$$y \leftarrow I \iff \exists x [x \in \setform(I) \land y = x]$$

- **Equality**: 2 Indeterminates are equal if they their resolved instance values are the same

$$I_1 = I_2 \iff x \leftarrow I_1, y \leftarrow I_2 [x = y]$$
- **Congruence**: 2 Indeterminates are congruent if their set of instances are the same.
$$I_1 \cong I_2 \iff \setform(I_1) = \setform(I_2)$$

- **Universal Indeterminate**: exists a Universal Indeterminate, whose set of Instances is the Universal Set.

$$\exists U \forall x \in \mathbb{U} [ x \leftarrow U]$$

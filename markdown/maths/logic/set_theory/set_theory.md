## Naive Set-Theory

a simple collection of somewhat vague but commonly used ideas and definitions used in set-theory


**Roster/Tabular Form**:

$$A = \{x, y, z, ...\}$$

**Set Builder Form**: for a well-defined formula $\varphi(x)$, and the under the axiomatic system the set is allowed.

$$A = \{x\ |\ \varphi(x)\}$$

> yes this is a bit dangerous definition but it's meant to capture of how it is used not how we axiomatize it or prevent paradoxes.

Universal Set: The set that contains everything based on the context it's used in.

$$\mathbb{U}$$

# Indeterminates

**Indeterminates** are objects with no determinate values.

## Indeterminate Forms
In limits the following are the commonly use indeterminate forms.

$$
I = \left\{ \frac{0}{0}, \frac{\infty}{\infty}, 0 \cdot \infty , 0^0 , \infty - \infty, \infty^0, 1^\infty, ... \right\}
$$

## Equations

**Underdeterminate**: a given system of equations where it contains more unknowns than number of independent equations within (i.e the equations cannot be algebraically manipulated to turn into any of the other given equations). e.g.

$$ax + by + c = 0$$

here $x$ and $y$ cannot be independently determined as they are dependent on each-other's value.

These underdeterminate systems can take a determinate form if count of the given count of variables minus the count of equations are given determinate values.

**Overdeterminate**: a given system of equations where the count of unknowns is less than the count of independent equations. e.g.

$$x = 5$$
$$x = 3$$

No value can satisfiy both of these equations simultaneous, hence x has no determinate value.

## Undecidability

Undecidability is where a statement an expression can neither be false or true.

here's an example:

$$\varphi(x) \land \lnot \varphi(x) = \top$$

whatever value for $\varphi(x)$ we may pick true/false it will be wrong, so the statement $\varphi(x)$ must be undecideable

These can also pop up when expression speak of their own validity, truthfulness which can lead to Undecidability.

1. Setup

    (i) Installation:

        $ sudo apt-get install git

    (ii) Initialization
        
        (ii) `$ git init` initalizes The Current Working Directory for GIT
    
        (iii) `$ git clone <SSH/>HTTP URL> ` Clones The Repository from the URL into The Current working Directory (automatically adds a source control)

    (iii) `$ git remote add origin <SSH/>HTTP URL>` Adds a Source Control to your pre-initalized Repository

2. Git Structure

    (i) 4 Stages of Git:

                            Staging                    Commit       (HEAD)        Push       (Cloud Repository)
        ---------------       |        -----------       |        -----------       |        ------------------
        | Working Dir | -------------> | Changes | -------------> | Version | -------------> | Source Control |
        ---------------                -----------                -----------                ------------------

    (ii) Working Directory: working directory is all files in their current state, no changes are yet currently tracked by git

    (iii) Index/Stage

        (a) Indexes/Stages all the files them for the Commit

        (b) `git add .` stages all The files

    (iv) Commit

        (a) A Commit Finalizes your Staged Changes and Creates a New Version of Your code and it requires a Commit MSG to keep track of and a optionally a description

        (b) `git commit -m "<commitMSG>"`


3. Source Control

    (i) A Source Control is a which is The Centralized Repository that powers all the other Repositories Cloned by Other Users

    (ii) Branches

        (a) Branches are seperate version of main Repository that have their own seperate history/commits

        (b) `main/master` is like the Stem of Everything it's the main branch all of the other branches come from it

        (c) Creating & using Braches:
            
            (I) Branches from `main/master` are created using `git branch <name>`

            (II) `git checkout <name>` switches to the Existing Branch

                (A) `-b` creates and switches to that branch

        (d) Merging Branch

            (I) `git merge <name>` Requests to merge The Branch into The Master/Main Branch (Arises Git conflicts to be resolved by the Owner of the repo)

3. Git Actions (Source Control Based)

    (i) Push

        (a) Push Action of Git Requests The Source Control to Accept your Commited Changes, changes can be denied or Accepted by the Source Control

        (b) `git push` Pushes all your changes into the Source Control

    (ii) Pull

        (a) Pull Action of Git Requests The Source Control to Get All The Lastest/Current Files from The Source Control to Your Local system and overides any of your local changes

        (b) `git pull` Pulls all the changes from the Source Control

4. Other Commands:

    (a) `git diff` shows all the changes made by the user

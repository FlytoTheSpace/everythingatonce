# Pure Mathematics

# Arithmetic

**Arithmetic**: a field of Mathematics containing the very Foundational Basics about it

## Successor, Predecessor

**Successor**: A Number `+1` of The Previous One

$
a+1
$

**Predecessor**: A Number `-1` for the Previous one

$

$

## Addition, Subtraction

$
a+b
$

- Repeated Succession $b$ count of times on $a$

## Number Writing System:

**Internation System of Numerals**: every *comma* `(,)` is placed after every 3rd digit

$
50,801,591
$

**Indian System of Numerals**: first *comma* `(,)` is placed after the 3rd digit and the rest of them are placed after every 2nd digit

$
5,08,01,591
$

**Roman Numerals**: using English Aplhabet to present Mathematical Number with a Known Quantity

- $I: 1$
- $V: 5$
- $X: 10$
- $L: 50$
- $C: 100$
- $D: 500$
- $M: 1000$

Rules:

- Every 2nd (eg $V, L, D... $) Roman Numeral Aplhabet is are Never:
  - Written behind the Symbol with Greater Value
  - Repeated
  - Subtracted
- Non Second Roman Number (eg $I, X, C, M ...$)
  - Not Repeated more then `3` times
  - Can only be used for Subtraction for Alphabets up to `+2` next to it

| Roman    | Normal  | Interpretation |
| -------- | ------- | -------------- |
| $$I   $$ | $$1  $$ | $$1         $$ |
| $$II  $$ | $$2  $$ | $$1+1       $$ |
| $$III $$ | $$3  $$ | $$1+1+1     $$ |
| $$IV $$  | $$4  $$ | $$-1+5      $$ |
| $$V $$   | $$5  $$ | $$5         $$ |
| $$...$$  | $$...$$ | $$...       $$ |

**Expanded Form**: large numbers are represeted as Unit Places, example:

$$
214 = 2 \times 100  + 1 \times 10 + 4 \times 1
$$

## Number System
Different Type of Number System that are used in Mathematics:

### Natural Numbers/Positive Numbers
**Natural Numbers**/**Positive Numbers**: a Set of every number that be found in Nature and it does Exists.
$$
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ...
$$
### Negative Numbers
**Negative Numbers**: a Set of Negative Version of every *Positive Numbers*.
$$
...-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1
$$
### Whole Numbers
**Whole Numbers**: A Set of every *Positive Numbers* and The Number `0`.
$$
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ...
$$
### Integers
**Integers**: A Set containing All *Positive* and *Negative* Numbers also also `0`
$$
...-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ...
$$
### Fractions
**Fractions**: Numbers that can be represented as a Fraction of a Number, can be both Positive/Negative, can also Represent *some* Decimal Numbers
$$
\frac{a}{b}
$$

Properties:
- $a/0$ is Not Allowed
- **Nominator**/**Numerator**: value That Sits on Top of The Fraction
- **Dominator**/**Denomitor** */: value That Sits on Bottom of The Fraction

$$
\frac{Nominator}{Dominator}
$$

- Negative Sign Switch
$$
\frac{-a}{b} = \frac{a}{-b}
$$
- No Value Change if both Nemoniator and Denominator are Multiply/Divided by the same value, Also caleld **Equivalent Fractions**
$$
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{a\times c}{b\times c} = \frac{a\div c}{b\div c}
$$

**Proper Fractions**: fractions where Nominator is smaller than The Denominator

**Arithmetic Operations**:

Addition:
$$
\frac{a}{b} + c = \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{1} = \frac{a}{b} + \frac{bc}{b} = \frac{a + bc}{b}
$$
$$
\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad}{bd} + \frac{bc}{bd} = \frac{ad + bc}{bd}
$$

Subtraction
$$
\frac{a}{b} - c = \frac{a}{b} - \frac{c}{1} = \frac{a}{b} - \frac{bc}{b} = \frac{a - bc}{b}
$$
$$
\frac{a}{b} - \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad}{bd} - \frac{bc}{bd} = \frac{ad - bc}{bd}
$$
Multiplication
$$
\frac{a}{b} \times c = \frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{1} = \frac{a \times c}{b}
$$
$$
\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a \times c}{b \times d}
$$
$$
\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a \times c}{b \times d}
$$

### Rational Numbers
**Rational Numbers**: Includes All of The Integers and Fractions
$$
...-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ...
$$
$$
...\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{4}{2}..., \frac{1}{5}, \frac{2}{5}, \frac{3}{5},... \frac{11}{10}...
$$

### Number System Properties:

**Closure**: A Property on Number System that whether if certain Arithmetic Operations and Comination can make The Result Escape The it's Number System.

| Rationals        | ✅      | ✅          | ✅            | ❌       |

### Other Number Types:
**Even Numbers**: Numbers that can only be represeted as a Multiple of $2$

$$
2a
$$
- These Number must always have  any of $0, 2, 4, 6, 8$ in the *one's unit digit place*

**Odd Numbers**: Numbers that can't be represeted as a Multiple of $2$

$$
2a+1
$$
- These Number must always have  any of $1, 3, 5, 6, 9$ in the *one's unit digit place*

**Prime Numbers**: Numbers that can only be divided by $1$ and *itself*, having exactly 2 factors

$$
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97...
$$

- Every Prime Number is an Odd-Number except `2`
- **Twin Primes**: difference between 2 Prime Number is `2`
  
  $(a+2 = b) ⟹ a, b$

  `(Note: Both Numbers Need to Prime Numbers for this to be true)`

$$
1.001, 1.002, 1.0000434 ...
$$

## Factors

A Number is a multiple of each of it's factors

- **1** is The Factor of every Number

  $1\times a = a$ 

- Every Number is a Factor of itself

  $a \div a = 1 $

- Every factor is an Exact divisor of that number and The Remainder should be `0`

  $ a \mod b = 0$ ✅

  $ a \mod b \neq 0$ ❌

- Every factor is Either Equal or Less than the number

  $ a \geq b $
  
  - `b` is factor of `a`

- Count of Factors is of a Number is **Finite**
- Count of Multiples of a Number is **Infinite**

| 6      | Divisible by both 2 and 3                     |
| 8      | with 4+ digits, last 3 digits divisible by it |
| 9      | sum of all digits divisible by it             |
| 10     | `0` in one's place                            |

# Pure Mathematics

# Arithmetic

**Arithmetic**: a field of Mathematics containing the very Foundational Basics about it

## Successor, Predecessor

**Successor**: A Number `+1` of The Previous One

$
a+1
$

**Predecessor**: A Number `-1` for the Previous one

$
a-1
$

## Addition, Subtraction
**Addition** `(Add)`: Sum of any 2 Numbers

$
a+b
$

- Repeated Succession $b$ count of times on $a$

**Subtraction** `(Subtract)`: Subtraction of One Number from another

$
a-b
$

- Repeated Predecession $b$ count of times on $a$

## Multiplication, Division
**Multiplication** `(Multiply)`: Multipli

$
a \times b
$
- Repeated Addition $b$ count of times on $a$

**Division** `(Divide)`: Subtraction of One Number from another

$
a / b
$

$
a \div b
$
- Divison of $a$ into `b` count of Parts/Components Evenly

# Algebra
**Algebra**: a field of Mathematics consisting of English Aplhabet Represeting Number, with many use cases such as Representing Unknown/Dynamic Values.
# Linear Alegbra
# Geometry
**Geometry**: a field of Mathematics consisting Entirely of Geometric Shapes and their Properties
# Trignometry
**Trignometry**: a sub-field of Geometry only consisting of Triangles and Their Angles related Geometry
# Number Theory
## Number Writing System:

**Internation System of Numerals**: every *comma* `(,)` is placed after every 3rd digit

$
50,801,591
$

**Indian System of Numerals**: first *comma* `(,)` is placed after the 3rd digit and the rest of them are placed after every 2nd digit

$
5,08,01,591
$

**Roman Numerals**: using English Aplhabet to present Mathematical Number with a Known Quantity

- $I: 1$
- $V: 5$
- $X: 10$
- $L: 50$
- $C: 100$
- $D: 500$
- $M: 1000$

## Number System
Different Type of Number System that are used in Mathematics:

### Natural Numbers/Positive Numbers
**Natural Numbers**/**Positive Numbers**: a Set of every number that be found in Nature and it does Exists.
$$
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ...
$$
### Negative Numbers
**Negative Numbers**: a Set of Negative Version of every *Positive Numbers*.
$$
...-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1
$$
### Whole Numbers
**Whole Numbers**: A Set of every *Positive Numbers* and The Number `0`.
$$
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ...
$$
### Integers
**Integers**: A Set containing All *Positive* and *Negative* Numbers also also `0`
$$
...-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ...
$$
### Fractions
**Fractions**: Numbers that can be represented as a Fraction of a Number, can be both Positive/Negative, can also Represent *some* Decimal Numbers
$$
\frac{a}{b}
$$

Properties:
- $a/0$ is Not Allowed
- **Nominator**/**Numerator**: value That Sits on Top of The Fraction
- **Dominator**/**Denomitor** */: value That Sits on Bottom of The Fraction

$$
\frac{Nominator}{Dominator}
$$

- Negative Sign Switch
$$
\frac{-a}{b} = \frac{a}{-b}
$$
- No Value Change if both Nemoniator and Denominator are Multiply/Divided by the same value, Also caleld **Equivalent Fractions**
$$
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{a\times c}{b\times c} = \frac{a\div c}{b\div c}
$$

**Proper Fractions**: fractions where Nominator
**Arithmetic Operations**:

Addition:
$$
\frac{a}{b} + c = \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{1} = \frac{a}{b} + \frac{bc}{b} = \frac{a + bc}{b}
$$
$$
\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad}{bd} + \frac{bc}{bd} = \frac{ad + bc}{bd}
$$

Subtraction
$$
\frac{a}{b} - c = \frac{a}{b} - \frac{c}{1} = \frac{a}{b} - \frac{bc}{b} = \frac{a - bc}{b}
$$
$$
\frac{a}{b} - \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad}{bd} - \frac{bc}{bd} = \frac{ad - bc}{bd}
$$
Multiplication
$$
\frac{a}{b} \times c = \frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{1} = \frac{a \times c}{b}
$$
$$
\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a \times c}{b \times d}
$$
$$
\frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a \times c}{b \times d}
$$

### Rational Numbers
**Rational Numbers**: Includes All of The Integers and Fractions
$$
...-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ...
$$
$$
...\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{2}, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{4}{2}..., \frac{1}{5}, \frac{2}{5}, \frac{3}{5},... \frac{11}{10}...
$$

### Number System Properties:

**Closure**: A Property on Number System that whether if certain Arithmetic Operations and Comination can make The Result Escape The it's Number System.

| ---------------- | -------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Natural/Positive | ✅      | ❌          | ✅            | ❌       |
| Negative         | -        | -           | -              | -        |
| Whole            | ✅      | ❌          | ✅            | ❌       |
| Integers         | ✅      | ✅          | ✅            | ❌       |
| Rationals        | ✅      | ✅          | ✅            | ❌       |

### Other Number Types:
**Even Numbers**: Numbers that can only be represeted as a Multiple of $2$

$$
2a
$$
- These Number must always have  any of $0, 2, 4, 6, 8$ in the *one's unit digit place*

**Odd Numbers**: Numbers that can't be represeted as a Multiple of $2$

$$
2a+1
$$
- These Number must always have  any of $1, 3, 5, 6, 9$ in the *one's unit digit place*
**Prime Numbers**: Numbers that can only be divided by $1$ and *itself*, having exactly 2 factors
**Composite Numbers**: Numbers that can only be divided by $1$ and *itself*, having more than 2 factors

**Decimals**: Floating Point Numbers that exists in-between Numbers
$$
1.001, 1.002, 1.0000434 ...
